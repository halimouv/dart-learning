  /*
  Create a simple number guessing game.

  Steps:
  1. Generate a secret number between 1 and 10 (use Random class).
  2. Ask the user to guess the number.
  3. Check if the guess is correct:
     - If correct â†’ print "ðŸŽ‰ Correct! You guessed the number!"
     - If too high â†’ print "Too high! Try again."
     - If too low â†’ print "Too low! Try again."
  4. Repeat until the user guesses it correctly.

  Bonus:
  - Count how many attempts it took.
  - Validate that the input is a number between 1 and 10.

  Focus:
  - Random numbers
  - Loops and conditions
  - Input handling

// Dart Basics | App 20 | Random Motivational Quote Generator

/*
Build a simple app that gives a motivational quote.

Steps:
1. Define a list of motivational quotes (at least 5).
2. Use the `Random` class to select one quote randomly.
3. Display it to the user when they run the app.

Example Output:
âœ¨ "Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."

Bonus:
- Ask user if they want another quote.
- Keep showing new quotes until the user types "exit".

Focus:
- Lists
- Random selection
- Loops and user interaction
